    <p>This is a text on my home page. I am a sentence that contains some
        <strong>boldface</strong> text and some <em>italic</em>text.
    </p>
    <a href="https://alansimpson.me/">Go To my site</a>
    <P>This is a practice paragraph that contains
        multiple sentences. A longer paragraph like this will allow me to see
        <em>word wrap</em> in action in my web browser. Word Wrap means that the
        text will wrap to fit the width of the browser window.
        So long as the browser window is a reasonable width, text will not shoot off past the right edge of the window
        forcing me to scroll to the rightto see it. The wrapping occurs at spaces between words at
        the ends of lines. That prevents any individual word from being split across two lines.
